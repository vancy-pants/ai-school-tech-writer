Based on the code changes and commit message provided in the Pull Request, it seems that the only relevant change is fixing the model name from "gtp-3.5-turbo-0.125" to "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125" in the utility.py file. This change does not directly impact the content of the README file.

Therefore, there is no need to update the README file based on the code changes and commit messages in the Pull Request. The README can remain as it is without any modifications.
