Based on the provided code changes and commit messages, it appears that the README file does not need to be updated at this time. The commit message "new branch to facilitate an update to the README file" suggests that the update to the README file will be done in a separate branch, which means the current README content remains relevant.

If further changes are made to the README file in the new branch, it would be advisable to ensure that the content aligns with the updated code changes and any new features or functionalities introduced. This will help maintain the clarity and relevance of the README file in relation to the project's current state.
